## Objective

The objective of this project is to provide a scalable way to develop BloodHound queries for Azure.


## Background 

| Challenge | Solution in this project | 
|-----------|----------|
| BloodHound needs to use a single file to import custom queries, which is hard to scale for developing a large number of queries while keeping them categorized. | Queries are organized into dedicated files for development, and merged to a single BloodHound-ready file on push to the repository. |
| Complex queries often require the use of boolean operators to include multiple types of nodes and edges (e.g. nodes including all Tier-0 Entra roles). Such queries often end up being very long and hard to maintain when values need to be updated, especially accross multiple queries. | Queries are written in pseudo code using variables instead of long node or edge boolean strings. The content of such variables is maintained in a single place, and variables are populated on push to the repository. <br> This approach makes the inclusion or exclusion of nodes trivial and easy to scale accross multiple queries (e.g. excluding built-in service principals). |


## Project structure

| Asset | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [.github/workflows](https://github.com/emiliensocchi/azurehound-queries/tree/main/.github/workflows) | Directory | Contains a Github Action executing the following on push to the repository: <br> 1. Populates variables used in pseudo code by queries located under [categories](https://github.com/emiliensocchi/azurehound-queries/tree/main/categories) (referred to as "categorized queries"). <br> 2. Merges all "categorized queries" with populated content to [customqueries.json](https://github.com/emiliensocchi/azurehound-queries/blob/main/customqueries.json). |
| [categories](https://github.com/emiliensocchi/azurehound-queries/tree/main/categories) | Directory | Contains "categorized queries" organized in dedicated files for each category. Those queries are written in pseudo code using [variables](https://github.com/emiliensocchi/azurehound-queries/tree/main/variables) for complex nodes and edges. |
| [variables](https://github.com/emiliensocchi/azurehound-queries/tree/main/variables) | Directory | Contains variable names and associated content, such as tiered roles and permissions. This is where content can be updated in a single place to populate variables used in different queries. |
| [customqueries.json](https://github.com/emiliensocchi/azurehound-queries/blob/main/customqueries.json) | File | BloodHound-ready file. Contains the latest version of all queries merged from different categories with populated variables. |

## Importing merged queries to BloodHound 

### BloodHound Legacy

Copy [customqueries.json](https://github.com/emiliensocchi/azurehound-queries/blob/main/customqueries.json) to the following location and refresh "Custom Queries" in the analysis tab of the search panel within BloodHound: 

```code
C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\bloodhound\customqueries.json
```

### BloodHound Community Edition (CE)

Importing queries in bulk is currently not trivial in BloodHound CE (BHCE), but it can be achieved using the `/api/v2/saved-queries` endpoint of the BHCE API.

Here is a high-level example using curl:

```code
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8080/api/v2/saved-queries' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN-VALUE>' \
  -d '{"name":"<QUERY-NAME>", "query":"<CYPHER-QUERY>"}'
```

This repository is actively used for personal use and queries may change, disappear or stop working at any time. Additionally, the tiering of roles and permissions used in this project is partly based on a personal tiering model, which does not necessarily conmply with all companies.
